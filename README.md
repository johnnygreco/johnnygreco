## Hi, I'm Johnny 👋

I enjoy building thoughtful software/data/ML solutions that add value to my team and broader community.

Some fun facts about me 🙈
- 🔭 I used to be an astronomer. 
- 🤘 I once dropped out of college in pursuit of rock stardom.
- 🍣 I was a sushi chef during my first round of college.
- 🎰 I was born and raised in Las Vegas (no, I didn't live in a casino).
